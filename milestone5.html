<h2>Milestone 5: User Study</h2>
<b>Introduction</b>
<br/>
<em>Describe your motivation and goals. Note your driving questions and hypotheses.</em>
<br/>
<p>Moving forward in the design process for our application, we are looking to find more specific use-cases for silent video communication and create features in future prototype iterations to support these specific scenarios.  Through our user testing, we want to quantify  various components of our application such as video/message length and number of videos per conversation thread based on prompts for different communication scenarios.</p>

<p>Our hypothesis is that light-hearted conversation topics will result in shorter message cards and  longer videos and conversation threads as our application is meant to be an information means of communication. Conversely, serious conversations will result in longer message cards and shorter videos and conversation threads.  We predict that people who are avid users of Snapchat will be more engaged in our app and thus have longer videos and thread lengths.</p>

<b>Methods</b><br/>
<em>Describe your study design and tasks. Whom did you recruit and how did you recruit them?</em>
<br/>
<p>We will run user tests on a few different groups of people. Since we are interested in exploring how deaf people interact with our app, we plan to recruit a deaf person who is a fellow colleague of our mentor. In addition, since our app is similar to other quick-video communication apps like Snapchat, we will run studies on people who are avid users of these apps as well as people who do not use such apps. This will give us insight into how we differentiate ourselves from the other video-communication apps.</p>

<p>We will conduct an observational user study where we present two users that do not know each other with several conversation prompts (in a randomized order for each study) and our application.  We will only provide a brief overview of the application at the beginning and leave it up to the users to discover the step by step processes for creating and responding to videos.  This will allow us to test the intuitiveness of our design.  Additionally, we will use the data to determine the average video length, average text card message length, and the number of back and forth videos in a conversation.  After the study, we will ask users their opinions on the least intuitive steps in the video communication process and their suggestions for redesign.</p>

<b>Results</b><br/>
<em>Describe your data and present the results of data analysis (observations, statistics, charts, etc).</em>

<br/><br/>

<b>Discussion</b><br/>
<em>Synthesize what you learned, document any shortcomings or caveats or your testing.</em>

<br/><br/>

<b>Implications</b><br/>
<em>Describe how you plan to apply the study results in the next iteration of your application.</em>

<h2>Milestone 2: Storyboarding and Skit</h2>

<h4>1. Silent Video Communication</h4>
<p>This application allows users to communicate with friends through a series of short, silent video clips with attached captions. The idea is to make video-viewing accessible anywhere and at any time. Without audio, people can view videos in noisy places, during boring meetings, in lectures, etc. (and there's no need to use headphones). Every time the user opens his/her laptop, they will be notified if they have a new video message. If so, they will watch the video and immediately be prompted to record a short video in response.</p>

<h4>2. Show and Tell</h4>
<p>Show & Tell is a way to be a part of the videos you share with friends! Immediately after recording a video with the rear facing camera, Show & Tell turns the camera on you allowing you to narrate parts of the video that you think need some explanation while your video plays back. When you sent your Show & Tells to friends and family, they'll see the original video as well as the narrated segments played right underneath..</p>

<h4>3. Motivation Buddies</h4>
<p>Motivation Buddies is an application for people who want to make a significant change in their lives but can benefit from having a friend as a motivational coach.  Users pair with a friend to become motivation buddies where they each will act as coaches for eachother.  Each coach posts a motivational video encouraging their buddy to perform a specific action towards their desired improvement, and the friend being motivated posts a video response of them performing the action.  This process repeats as each friend makes incremental changes in their lives empowered by the motivation of their friend.</p>

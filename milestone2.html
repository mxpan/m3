<h2>Milestone 2: Storyboarding and Skit</h2>

<h4>1. Silent Video Communication</h4>
<p>This application allows users to communicate with friends through a series of short, silent video clips with attached captions. The idea is to make video-viewing accessible anywhere and at any time. Without audio, people can view videos in noisy places, during boring meetings, in lectures, etc. (and there's no need to use headphones). Every time the user opens his/her laptop, they will be notified if they have a new video message. If so, they will watch the video and immediately be prompted to record a short video in response.</p>
